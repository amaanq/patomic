     * OPTIONS
     *
     * - options are passed directly to each implementation, and it is up to
     * each implementation to decide how to handle them
     * - options do not affect the correctness of any implementation or op; any
     * op that is obtained both when passing and not passing an option is
     * equally correct in terms of thread-safety and memory ordering
     * - options MAY affect constraints that do not affect thread-safety or
     * memory ordering, namely alignment requirements and efficiency of
     * implementation
     *
     * WARNING:
     * - you should be cautious about using an op obtained without an option in
     * the same place as an op obtained with the option (and vice versa)
     * - if the option relaxes alignment requirements, then (without further
     * checks) you could end up with misaligned memory access when using an op
     * obtained without the option
